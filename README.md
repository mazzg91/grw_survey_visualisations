# grw_survey_visualisations

These are visualisations I created with survey data from a Google form (csv export). The survey was sent to members and volunteers of a greyhound rescue charity as part of a change programme. The aim with the visualisations was to display the responses to each question as succinctly and clearly as possible, so that they could be included in reports.

The visualisations are varied (some bar charts, pie charts, bubble charts) to engage the reader of the report, and to highlight the pertinent information (how close or different the voting was on certain issues).

All visualisations were created using matplotlib and seaborn. I was given an initial dataset to work with (before the survey had closed) in order to set up the script so that once the survey had closed the full dataset could be loaded in.

The reports can be read <a href="https://greyhoundrescuewales.co.uk/about/programme-for-change/surveys/?fbclid=IwAR2ovepZYsZ1OLZI_eH_r5Ibp-lAcwDbMKYjvPvy0j_fXEj6-JKkmUiqjRQ">here<a/>.
